# We have -Wno-unused-parameter so that the compiler
# doesn't complain too much about our stubs.

CXXFLAGS=-std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-unused-private-field

# Change to this before final submission:

# CXXFLAGS=-std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -Werror

# Note that you should not use `-Wall` and `-Werror` together in production-grade code.
# Because, when switching compilers, you may get additional warnings which would turn into errors.
